## What is a crypto wallet?

-   In short, a crypto wallet is a tool you can use to interact with a blockchain network.
-   You need to understand that you can access your crypto assets easily with the help of a wallet. How? First of all, remember that cryptocurrency ownership is considerably different from ownership of traditional currency. As a matter of fact, cryptocurrency is actually a collection of codes and is stored on the blockchain with a particular address.
-   The assets you store on blockchain have a private key and a public key. The public key serves as your wallet address which people can use to send payments to you. On the other hand, the private key is like your ATM PIN, which allows you to access your crypto assets.
-   Crypto wallets don't truly store digital assets. Your crypto wallet stores the private keys and public keys of assets, which rest safely on a blockchain network.
-   Note that the coins never truly leave the blockchain; they are just transferred from one address to another.

## Types of the crypto wallets

Crypto wallets can be divided into two categories: **Hot** and **Cold**.

-   A hot wallet is any wallet that is connected somehow to the Internet. These wallets are quite easy to set up, and the funds are quickly accessible, making them convenient for traders and other frequent users.
-   Cold wallets, on the other hand, have no connection to the Internet. Instead, they use a physical medium to store the keys offline, making them resistant to online hacking attempts.

### Types of Hot Wallets

The following are descriptions of some of the most common and important types: web, desktop, and mobile wallets.

**Web wallets**

-   You can use web wallets to access blockchains through a browser interface without having to download or install anything. This includes both exchange wallets and other browser-based wallet providers.
-   In most cases, you can create a new wallet and set a personal password to access it. However, some service providers hold and manage the private keys on your behalf.

**Desktop wallets**

-   As the name implies, a desktop wallet is software you download and execute locally on your computer. Unlike some web-based versions, desktop wallets give you full control over your keys and funds.
-   The application will help in generating a data file for holding the keys of the users. This file contains the private key information used to access your cryptocurrency addresses, so you should encrypt it with a personal password.
-   In general, desktop wallets may be considered safer than most web versions, but it's crucial to make sure your computer is clean of viruses and malware before setting up and using a cryptocurrency wallet.

**Mobile wallets**

-   Mobile wallets function much like their desktop counterparts but are designed specifically as smartphone applications. These are quite convenient as they allow you to send and receive cryptocurrencies through the use of QR codes.
-   Just as computers, however, mobile devices are vulnerable to malicious apps
    and malware infection. So it's recommended that you encrypt
    your mobile wallet with a password, and back up your private keys (or seed phrase) in case your smartphone gets lost or broken.

### Types of Cold Wallets

There are two common variants of cold wallets such as paper wallets and hardware wallets.

**Paper wallets**

-   As the name suggests, a paper wallet consists of a piece of paper on which the public and private keys of a cryptocurrency address are physically printed out. These keys are often displayed as QR codes, along with their respective alphanumeric strings.
-   After a paper wallet is generated, its owner can receive cryptocurrency transactions by sharing their address with others. Transactions can be made by either manually inputting the keys or by scanning the QR codes with a smartphone.

**Hardware wallets**

-   Hardware wallets, on the other hand, truly define the principles of designing a cold wallet. They offer security by completely avoiding the online exposure of private keys.
-   Hardware wallets save private keys on a physical device in an offline environment and work just like a flash drive. Hardware wallets are one of the most easy-to-use crypto wallet types in cold wallets because you can connect them easily to computers or any other device by using a USB drive.

## The importance of backups

-   Losing access to your cryptocurrency wallets can be quite costly. So it's important to back them up regularly. In many cases, this is achieved by simply backing up data files or seed phrases.
-   Essentially, a seed phrase works like a root key that generates and gives access to all keys and addresses in a crypto wallet. Also, if you opted for password encryption, remember to back up your password as well.

## Closing thoughts

-   Crypto wallets are an integral part of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are one of the basic pieces of infrastructure that make it possible to send and receive funds through blockchain networks.
-   Each wallet type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's crucial to understand how they work before moving your funds.
