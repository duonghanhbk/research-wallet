## Introduction

-   Ever wondered how and where your crypto is stored? There are many different types of crypto wallets that token holders can use to store crypto. Based on the type of security for your funds, you can find two distinct categories of wallets such as custodial and non-custodial wallets.
-   Both custodial and non-custodial wallets have their pros and cons. A detailed overview of each type of wallet followed by a custodial vs non-custodial wallet comparison on the grounds of specific factors can help in choosing the right pick.

## Custodial crypto wallet

-   As the name suggests, a custodial crypto wallet is one where your assets are held in custody for you. This means a third party will hold and manage your private keys on your behalf. In other words, you won't have full control over your funds - nor the ability to sign transactions. But using a custodial crypto wallet service isn't necessarily a bad thing.
-   Custodial wallets present one of the most crucial advantages for beginners, i.e., ease of use. You don’t need advanced technical know-how about cryptocurrencies for using custodial wallets. Just create an account with your email and password, and then login into the custodial wallet.
-   However, you have to put the custody of your funds with the wallet provider in the case of custodial wallets. It means that you are entrusting your private keys to a third party. That's why it's important to choose a reliable exchange or service provider.

## Non-custodial crypto wallet

-   A non-custodial crypto wallet is a wallet where only the holder possesses and controls the private keys. For users who want full control over their funds, non-custodial wallets are the best option.
-   Since there are no intermediaries, you can trade crypto directly from your wallets. It's a good option for experienced traders and investors, who know how to manage and protect their private keys and seed phrases.
-   In most cases, the private key is generally a 12 to 24-word recovery phrase. Users have to store the recovery phrase in a secure location.
-   The recovery phrase is an important highlight for all crypto wallets as it helps in regaining access to the wallet. However, any individual with the recovery phrase could access the non-custodial wallet. So, the user should refrain from storing their recovery phrase online or sharing it with other people.

## Pros and cons of custodial wallets

-   **Pros**: The major downside of custodial wallets is that you have to trust your funds and private keys to a third party. In most cases, these service providers will also require identity verification (KYC).
-   **Cons**: The advantage, however, is the peace of mind and convenience. You won't have to worry about losing your private key and you can contact customer support when you run into trouble.
-   When using custodial services, make sure you choose a reliable company that offers high security and insurance coverage. Look out for custodians that are regulated and compliant.

## Pros and cons of non-custodial wallets

-   **Pros**: Without a third-party guardian, non-custodial wallets offer full control over your keys and funds. In other words, your assets are truly yours and you can be your own bank. In addition, non-custodial transactions tend to be faster as you don’t have to wait for withdrawal approval. Finally, without a custodian, you don't incur extra custodial fees, which may be costly depending on the service provider you choose.
-   **Cons**: One disadvantage of using non-custodial wallets relates to accessibility and ease of use. They are usually less user-friendly and tend to pose a problem to first-time crypto holders.

## Closing thoughts

-   Custodial wallet or non-custodial wallet? Most crypto users use both, but it all depends on your needs.
-   If you like having full control over your assets, or simply want to use blockchain technology to interact with DeFi applications, you should consider a non-custodial wallet.
-   However, if you are looking for a service provider that can take care of your storage needs while you trade or invest, you can look for reliable custodial wallet service providers.
