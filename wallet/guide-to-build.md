## Overview

The goal of the project is to build a Crypto wallet that will allow users to explore, buy, and sell cryptocurrencies created through smart contracts.

## Types and Examples of Crypto Wallets

If you want to create a cryptocurrency wallet app, you need to understand what types of crypto wallets exist out there.

### By Governance

The first thing to consider is whether you want to create a centralized or decentralized wallet. These solutions are also commonly referred to as:

-   Custodial crypto wallets
-   Non-custodial crypto wallets

If you don’t know what is it, please read previous document **Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets**

### By Platform

Depending on what software we are used to and what devices we own, we may run crypto wallets on various platforms:

-   mobile
-   desktop
-   web
-   hardware

## Main features of crypto wallet applications

What features should you plan to create and own a cryptocurrency wallet with a strong adoption? The basic components should include:

### User Authorization

-   Given the popularity and value of cryptocurrencies, wallet apps are prone to many security attacks.
-   That’s why it is always best to enhance the user authentication of your crypto wallet app with a two-factor or multi-factor authentication (2FA or MFA). The 2FA or MFA provides an additional layer of security that many conventional non-crypto apps do not offer.
-   This is done in addition to your username and password to make access to your wallet all the more secure.

### QR code scanner

-   A QR Code Scanner feature adds speed, convenience, simplicity, and security to your crypto wallet app transactions.
-   If your crypto wallet app has a QR code scanner integration, it can facilitate automatic scanning of the wallet addresses and the public keys. As a result, it enhances cryptocurrency transactions with just a single click.

### Multiple Cryptocurrencies

-   Your wallet must support more than one cryptocurrency.
-   It is because many different currencies are added time-to-time, and their values keep on changing. So you wouldn't want to keep many other wallets to store your cryptos.

### Push Notifications

-   Push notifications are an essential feature through which your users can always be alerted & notified of crypto transactions. With this feature, the users of your cryptocurrency application will be notified about the price of their digital money, the success, as well as the failure of any transactions, etc.
-   This feature can ensure that notifications to all transactions on your account are done in real-time.

### Conversion rate

-   No cryptocurrency wallet app is complete without access and calculating transaction fees based on ever-changing conversion rates.
-   Since the cryptocurrency wallet application will allow users to make money transactions between different modes – between the same digital currency, between different digital currencies, and between digital and fiat currencies, they will need to be updated with the currency value in real time.

### List of addresses

-   This feature will aim to make the entire transaction much faster and more convenient by providing users with a mode to manage the addresses with which they frequently conduct digital currency transactions.

### Transaction

-   Users will be able to transfer and receive digital currencies via your crypto application in an entirely tamper-proof and fast manner.
-   Moreover, they can view their available balance and the entire transaction history. This is because all completed transactions are transmitted to the blockchain network.

### Optional Session Logout

-   This is an excellent feature for the security measures of your app.
-   With this in place, your users, if inactive, will get automatically logged out after a fixed time and will need to re-login if they want to use the app.

## Challenges You May Face When You Make a Bitcoin Wallet

What issues are you likely to run into during your crypto wallet development? The most common technical and business challenges include:

-   Blockchain forks, which happen not so often, but when they do, you need to decide which version of a blockchain your wallet will support.
-   The necessity to integrate with multiple blockchains to support more coins.
-   Easy to use for new users.

## Technology Stack for Cryptocurrency Wallet Development

First of all, different teams choose technologies based on their experience. Therefore, it’s entirely possible to work with varying stacks of tech to build crypto wallets. At the same time, there will need to be some basic blockchain foundation for such crypto projects. Here’s an example of a tech stack that will work.

### Mobile App

-   We highly recommend our clients develop cross-platform solutions. This shouldn’t come as a surprise – using this approach allows companies to save time, money, and effort. Thus, you will need [React Native](https://code-care.com/react-native-development-services/) to create a frontend.
-   Or Kotlin for Android, Swift for iOS. These native programming languages supported by Google and Apple offer the most advanced toolsets for making a mobile crypto wallet for iPhones and Android smartphones.

### Web

-   If you are building a web wallet app, you should use ReactJS/NextJS and above to build the front end along with HTML5 and CSS3.
-   We highly recommend using Typescript for the wallet function.

## Conclusion

Summing up, when you’re all set to start with the crypto wallet app development, make sure you do the following:

-   Decide the type of wallet you want.
-   Decide on all the features of your app.
-   Which version of blockchain does your wallet support?
-   Design a simple and user-friendly interface.
-   Choose the technology stack for development
-   Make sure to conduct extensive testing before the launch of your wallet.
